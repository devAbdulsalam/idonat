# 🩸 iDonat – Save Lives. Get Rewarded.

iDonat is a decentralized blood donation and emergency medical response platform built on the Internet Computer (ICP). It connects donors, hospitals, and patients in real-time using AI-powered smart matching, blockchain security, and community-driven rewards.

This project is inspired by the urgent need for timely blood donations and faster emergency response in Nigeria and other underserved regions.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Smart Donor Matching
AI connects hospitals with the closest, most suitable donors based on blood type, availability, and urgency.

✅ Real-Time Emergency Alerts
Hospitals can send verified, location-based alerts to potential donors during critical shortages.

✅ Donor Dashboard
Track your donation history, eligibility status, and impact in lives saved.

✅ Rewards System
Earn \$LBT tokens for every successful donation. Redeem tokens for health benefits, discounts, or local services.

✅ Leaderboard & Community
Top donors are recognized publicly. Teams and blood drives can compete to encourage consistent participation.

✅ Secure & Decentralized
Built on ICP using Motoko. Health data is private, encrypted, and stored in tamper-proof canisters.

✅ Multilingual & Localized
Supports major Nigerian languages (e.g., Hausa, Yoruba, Igbo) with voice support for non-literate users.

✅ AI Assistant
Get first-aid triage advice, donation reminders, health tips, and motivational nudges from a built-in chatbot.
